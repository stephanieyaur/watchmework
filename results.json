In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially successful and, struggling with severe depression and poverty, committed suicide at the age of 37.","entityPresentationInfo":{"entityScenario":"DominantEntity","entityTypeHints":["Person"]},"id":"https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#Entities.0","name":"Vincent van Gogh","webSearchUrl":"https://www.bing.com/entityexplore?q=Vincent+van+Gogh&filters=sid:%222139c867-ec5a-5576-5987-9a4079e0f07c%22&elv=AXXfrEiqqD9r3GuelwApulobj4Y!CHp8xh*wW43szU3iKfgFZq9gLdl7pOHln0czI04R3hAUfojPc8A2NeNoKBTl2tj1eL0s8CJ4JFUYG0nT"}]},"images":{"id":"https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#Images","isFamilyFriendly":true,"readLink":"https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/images/search?q=vincent+van+gogh&qpvt=vincent+van+gogh","value":[{"contentSize":"1929621 B","contentUrl":"https://media.vogue.fr/photos/5c8a55363d44a0083ccbef54/2:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-625257378.jpg","encodingFormat":"jpeg","height":3840,"hostPageDisplayUrl":"https://www.vogue.fr/fashion-culture/article/vincent-van-gogh-8-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-painter","hostPageUrl":"https://www.vogue.fr/fashion-culture/article/vincent-van-gogh-8-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-painter","name":"Vincent van Gogh: 8 things you didn\u2019t know about the painter | Vogue Paris","thumbnail":{"height":711,"width":474},"thumbnailUrl":"https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP._8CW0ghWf0Kie2nQEIzdbgHaLH&pid=Api","webSearchUrl":"https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=vincent+van+gogh&id=D2FFC9E0AFB0D86C925A39E1A78F60061A674C9B&FORM=IARRTH","width":2560},{"contentSize":"2773379 B","contentUrl":"http://s.fixquotes.com/files/author/vincent-van-gogh_PsTYa.jpg","encodingFormat":"jpeg","height":2592,"hostPageDisplayUrl":"http://fixquotes.com/authors/vincent-van-gogh.htm","hostPageUrl":"http://fixquotes.com/authors/vincent-van-gogh.htm","name":"Vincent Van Gogh the Artist, biography, facts and quotes","thumbnail":{"height":632,"width":474},"thumbnailUrl":"https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.NcMWKpln6klD2-wzSZA18AHaJ4&pid=Api","webSearchUrl":"https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=vincent+van+gogh&id=72643378FD025BE0271A8E10F55C4AFF616A3198&FORM=IARRTH","width":1944},{"contentSize":"430807 B","contentUrl":"https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTY2NTIzMzc4MTI2MDM4MjM5/vincent_van_gogh_self_portrait_painting_musee_dorsay_via_wikimedia_commons_promojpg.jpg","encodingFormat":"jpeg","height":1200,"hostPageDisplayUrl":"https://www.biography.com/artist/vincent-van-gogh","hostPageUrl":"https://www.biography.com/artist/vincent-van-gogh","name":"Vincent van Gogh -
